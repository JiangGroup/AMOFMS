1. Determine Coarse-Grained Force Field
---------------------------------------

For your research system, determine the type of coarse-grained (CG) force field to optimize. AMOFMS currently supports `MARTINI2 <http://md.chem.rug.nl/index.php>`__, `MARTINI3 <http://md.chem.rug.nl/index.php>`__, and `SPICA <https://www.spica-ff.org/>`__ CG force fields.

.. note::

   Since the SPICA force field is developed based on `LAMMPS <https://lammps.org>`__, using it in GROMACS requires pre-installation of `spica-tools <https://github.com/SPICA-group/spica-tools>`__ and the `gromacs-spica patch <https://github.com/SPICA-group/gromacs-spica>`__.
